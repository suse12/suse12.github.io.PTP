PathToPeaceThroughVegism
========================

A game based on gabriele's 2048 using pics of our fellow beings still being used and abused. Get through all the tiles to find the symbol of peace...

Cats were the first to be sacred, following are dogs, horses, pigs, lamb, cows, fish, maybe someday shrimp, cows milk(meant for calves!) and there are more but those are the tiles I chose to use. All depicted as cartoon to show that games using real sentient beings is unthinkable! Finally, the symbol of peace both the hand and the drawing are reached....
It is a nearly impossible path. Same as in life, but you'll see... You WILL want to keep striving for the "prize"....
Shouldn't i be something worthwhile?

I am an anonymous individual and far from perfect yet I make a valiant attempt as much as is humanly possible. 
So GOOD LUCK!! And have fun too.
